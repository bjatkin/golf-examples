# GOLF Engine examples
this repo contains several example games desinged to show how the golf fantasy engine works. it contains one main project right now located in the blood directory.

of the GOLF engine including things like sprite sheets, map files and drawing text on screen. It also demonstrates common RPG game elements like character movement
