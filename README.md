# GOLF Engine examples
this repo contains several example games desinged to show how the golf fantasy engine works. it contains one main project right now located in the blood directory.
This is a small ARPG game where you play a vampire killing monsters and collecting there blood. It demonstrates a simple ECS system as well as many of the features
of the GOLF engine including things like sprite sheets, map files and drawing text on screen. It also demonstrates common RPG game elements like character movement
collision detection, simple enemy AI, dialouge boxes and more. the code is currently in development so to see the final version you'll need to check back later.
