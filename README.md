# GOLF Engine Examples

This repo contains several demo examples for the [GoLF engine](https://github.com/bjatkin/golf-engine). These examples
were designed to showcase the types of games that can be made with GoLF as well as providing developers with a reference
for how to use the API. Currently, this repo contains 4 different projects. Each of these mini project is explained below.
The different features used in the games are also listed to make it easy to find code examples to help you with the
GoLF engine.

# Running GoLF Examples

Running these game demos is easy. First, install [go](https://golang.org/) on your computer if it is not already.
Next clone this repo as well as the [GoLF engine repo](https://github.com/bjatkin/golf-engine). Then, open terminal
and navigate into the golf-examples/demos repository. From here run the golf_toolkit binary located 
in the golf-engine/util/[your os]/ directory. This will start the golf toolkit which you can use to 
start a simple web server. Simply run play [demo name] and a localhost server will be started. 
You're defalut browser will also be opened to http://localhost:8080 where you will be able to play the demo.
